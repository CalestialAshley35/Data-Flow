<p>Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University. The company was incorporated in Menlo Park, California, and its mission was to organize the worldâ€™s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Google's initial search engine was unique because it ranked web pages based on their relevance using a system called PageRank, which considered the number and quality of links to a page.</p><p><br /></p><p>In 1999, Google moved to its current headquarters in Mountain View, California, known as the Googleplex. Over the years, Google expanded beyond search into various services and products, including Gmail, Google Maps, Google Drive, and the Android operating system. In 2004, Google went public with an initial public offering (IPO) and rapidly grew into one of the most valuable companies in the world.</p><p><br /></p><p>In 2015, Google reorganized under a new parent company, Alphabet Inc., with Sundar Pichai becoming the CEO of Google, while Larry Page and Sergey Brin became the CEO and President of Alphabet, respectively. Alphabet serves as a holding company for Google and other ventures like Waymo (self-driving cars) and Verily (life sciences).</p><p><br /></p><p>Google has become a dominant force in digital advertising, largely due to its search engine and platforms like YouTube, which it acquired in 2006. The company has also made significant investments in artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and hardware products like the Pixel phone and Google Home smart speakers.</p><p><br /></p><p>Despite its success, Google has faced numerous challenges, including antitrust investigations, privacy concerns, and criticism over its handling of misinformation and hate speech on its platforms. Nevertheless, Google remains one of the most influential tech companies globally, with a vast array of products and services used by billions of people every day.</p>
